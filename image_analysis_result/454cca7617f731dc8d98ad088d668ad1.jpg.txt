**Setup Context:** The scene context is a restaurant.

**People:** There are 12 people in the picture. They are sitting at a table eating. Two people are drinking beer, and the emotions detected are: fear, happy, angry, and fear, which suggests that the atmosphere is not entirely pleasant.

**Brand Detection:** There is one brand mentioned in the OCR results: "Tiger". It is unclear if it refers to a beer brand, but it is mentioned in the OCR results.

**Products:** Unfortunately, there is no information about beer kegs and bottles in the given data.

**Promotional Materials:** There is no information about posters, banners, and billboards in the given data.

Note: The OCR results contain a mix of text and possibly keywords, but it is difficult to determine the exact meaning of the text without more context. Therefore, I did not include any products or promotional materials in my response.
