Based on the provided information, here are the insights:

**Setup Context:**
The scene context is unclear from the provided information, as there are no explicit hints about the location or type of establishment. Therefore, it is difficult to determine a specific context (e.g., bar, restaurant, grocery store, supermarket, boozer).
